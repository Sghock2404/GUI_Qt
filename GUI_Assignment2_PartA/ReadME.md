1) Develop a QT program that has widgets ready to be used with the CDMA simulation 
program you developed in assignment 1. The program is referred to as CDMASim. At 
this point, the widget DO NOT Interact with CDMASim.

2) The widgets are input widgets e.g., a slider or a Nob-controller. However, each input 
widget should be connected to an LCD-display output widget.

3) Place the widgets on a grid layout and use different widgets for each input.

4) The required inputs are:

a. The length of the cable. 
b. The maximal length of a message.
c. The probability of generating a massage (specified in percent)
d. The maximal number of ticks for carrier sensing
e. The total number of ticks for the entire simulation.
